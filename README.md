I completed this task in Springboot and using H2 database.

First of all thanks for this opportunity.
    

      This task start from seller page.
First I make All packages depending upon requirements. Also Add dependencies in "pom.xml" file.

In Controller package I make "HomeController" and "SellerController"
In SellerConterller class I add All Mapping methods for  "Categories " As well as for "products "
Seller can add category,delete category Also  Add Product with category Wies also add product photo.
I use h2 database for data.
With Backend I was make front-end Part of sellerpage

But I unfortunately can't make  Swgger Document API due to some error after adding swgger dependencies from online I try many tiems but errors not solved.

You just Run The project after That go in any webpage and type

http://localhost:8080/seller/categories ==for Category page.
